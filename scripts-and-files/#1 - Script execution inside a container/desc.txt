A primitive training script that createas a Docker image, builds a container and executes another script copied from host's file system inside this container. 
Script.sh is the one that will be run inside the container. 

Run runMe.sh to create Docker image. You will be logged into the container's shell, user 'exit' to go back to host.

Docker should be already installed on a host machine ;)
